## [0.15.0] - 2016-06-03

### Changed

* Changed: plugin name from "php_phpunit" to "phpunitkit". The plugin was renamed because the last name was rejected by the Package Control channel.
  - If you previously installed manually then remove the installation and install via Package Control. Search for phpunitkit.

## [0.14.1] - 2016-05-16

### Fixed

* Fixed [#35](https://github.com/gerardroche/sublime-phpunit/issues/35): Cannot run "Run Single Test" with the latest build of Sublime Text (build 3114)

## [0.14.0] - 2016-05-15

### Added

* Added: Now available on Package Control

### Changed

* Changed: Renamed package from "phpunit" to "php_phpunit". This was needed in order to provide the plugin via Package Control. If you are having issues then either remove your existing plugin installation and install via Package Control, making sure to install the plugin by me, PHP PHPUnit (gerardroche), or rename your existing installation to "phpunit".

## [0.13.0] - 2016-01-29

### Added

* Added [#34](https://github.com/gerardroche/sublime-phpunit/issues/34): Option to disable composer support (phpunit.composer). Defaults to true.

## [0.12.0] - 2016-01-12

### Changed

* Changed: switch file command caption is now "PHPUnit: Switch Test Case / Class Under Test"

## [0.11.0] - 2015-11-13

### Added

## [0.10.1] - 2015-09-30

### Fixed

* Fixed: incorrect file path to settings when opening from the command palette

## [0.10.0] - 2015-09-30

### Added

* Added: "phpunit.development" setting to enable/disable plugin development utilities

### Changed

* Changed: settings are no longer loaded from a plugin specific settings file i.e. phpunit.sublime-settings

    There is, in my opinion, a bad practice of each and every plugin having its
    own settings file. This plugin no longer does this. All plugin settings are prefixed with the name of the plugin followed by a period i.e. "phpunit.".

    Settings are loaded in this order:

    1) Project Specific

    Example: Menu > Project > Edit Project

    ```
    {
        "settings": {
            "phpunit.save_all_on_run": true
        }
    }
    ```

    2) User

    Example: Menu > Preferences > Settings - User

    ```
    {
        "phpunit.save_all_on_run": true
    }
    ```

* Changed: "save_all_on_run" now only save files that exist on disk and have dirty buffers

    The reason for this change:

    When saving a file that doesn't exist on disk Sublime Text prompts with a "Save file" dialog, meanwhile the tests would run in the background anyways. We could prevent the tests from running until the user finishes handling the dialogs. If there is a desire for this please open an issue.

* Changed: renamed setting "phpunit.enable_keymaps" to "phpunit.keymaps"
* Changed: renamed setting "phpunit.enable_vi_keymaps" to "phpunit.keymaps"
* Changed: To enable vi keymaps both "phpunit.keymaps" and "phpunit.vi_keymaps" need to be set to true, previously only the vi_keymaps needed to be set to true

### Removed

* Removed: "phpunit" command #31

### Fixed

* Fixed: Keymaps now display the default `ctrl+...` keymaps in command palette. Previously the Vintage/Vintageous keymaps were displayed.

## [0.4.0] - 2015-05-03

### Changed

* Changed: Debug messages are now disabled by default. To enable debug messages set an environment variable to a non-blank value: `SUBLIME_PHPUNIT_DEBUG=yes`. To disable debug message set the variable to a blank value: `SUBLIME_PHPUNI_DEBUG=`. For example, on Linux Sublime Text can be opened at the Terminal with an exported environment variable: `export SUBLIME_PHPUNIT_DEBUG=yes; ~/sublime_text_3/sublime_text`. #6
* Changed: The last test run is now saved in memory for the current session, previously it was save to a file. #11
* Changed: Many refactorings including test runner commands are now Window commands, previously they were Text commands. There is no need for these commands to be instantiated for every view.

### Fixed

* Fixed: Test result progress highlighting was not displayed properly
* Fixed: Test result failures red background no longer matches trailing whitespace, previously the red background stretched the full width of the screen.
